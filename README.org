#+TITLE: GUI for Quantification of color

/early stages. The main useful file is analysisguyi.py all other files are test functions./
/Current tests included: Chi-Squared, Kruskal-Wallis, Kolmorogov-Smirnov/

Processes folders of photos and creates a dataframe for analysis. Current implementation works with hue, but switching to any other channel/Color Space is not difficult.
Objects must be segmented on a white background using [[https://github.com/hanskrupakar/COCO-Style-Dataset-Generator-GUI][COCO-Style-Dataset-Generator]]
Select a channel from a color space and run analysis (current example is of hue)


Analysis includes:
- Histogram
- Radar Plot
- Heatmap comparing statistics/p-values of a given test

Histogram of CIE L*A*B* channel 2
d[[./testing/cielab_000.png]]

Added color range selection
Select by:
- Direct values
- Dragging window
- Inverting selection
- Rotating color bar to center specified region

* Installation
- install anaconda
- conda create -n environment-name python=3.8 matplotlib seaborn
** using with existing environment
- for an existing anaconda environment such as that with the score log analysis
- conda activate analysis
- conda install -c anaconda seaborn
- pip install opencv-python
* using script
- open ./app/analysisGui.py in spyder
- run script (green play button)
- select color channel of a color space to analyze: (H, S, V), (L*, A*, B*), (B,G,R))
- select plots for the color channel
- type number of bins to use (resolution of the distribution, 255 is default)
- if there is a range within a color channel that is preffered press the button to select "color range picker"
- select the folder of one of the color morphs, press again to select the second folder, images will automatically be generated after two folders are selected
- select export to export graphs and data
