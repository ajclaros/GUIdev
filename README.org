#+TITLE: GUI for Quantification of color

/early stages. The main useful file is analysisguyi.py all other files are test functions./
/Current tests included: Chi-Squared, Kruskal-Wallis, Kolmorogov-Smirnov/

Processes folders of photos and creates a dataframe for analysis. Current implementation works with hue, but switching to any other channel/Color Space is not difficult.
Objects must be segmented on a white background using [[https://github.com/hanskrupakar/COCO-Style-Dataset-Generator-GUI][COCO-Style-Dataset-Generator]]
Select a channel from a color space and run analysis (current example is of hue)


Analysis includes:
- Histogram
- Radar Plot
- Heatmap comparing statistics/p-values of a given test

Histogram of CIE L*A*B* channel 2
